            <h3>Do I need to have a Rubik's Cube to join the club?</h3>
            <p>You will not need to have a Rubik's Cube to join the club! We believe that the club should be accessible to everyone and anyone who would like to join. Because of this, we will be offering our members an oppurtunity to buy a Rubik's Cube from us for $_. If you'd only like to borrow one, with a $_ deposit we will lend you one!</p>
