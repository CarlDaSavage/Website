        <h1>What Is the Cubing Club?</h1>
        <p1>Our main focus as the cubing club is to gather both new and experienced cubers. We want to teach different techniques,
          ranging from the beginner method on the 3x3 to CFOP to the gigantic megaminx. Our end goal is to have our members proficient in solving their Rubik's Cubes!</p>
        <h1>Non-Commital</h1>
        <p1>We aren't in the business of annoying you to come to our meetings. Our small help meetings will be on Tuesdays after school, and
          they'll just be a nice chill environment for people to hang out and maybe learn how to solve a Rubik's cube. We will be trying to create video tutorials later
          on the steps to solving a Rubik's Cube for those who don't feel like coming to the meetings or need extra help.</p>
        <h1>Helpful Environment</h1>
        <p>We just want everyone to learn! Whether you need to be walked through every single step, or you're a natural learner, you'll fit right in!</p>
        <h1>NUMBER ONE RULE</h1>
        <p> Don't be afraid to ask questions! Rubik's cubes are difficult. They take a lot of brain power to wrap your head around each of the moving pieces, and we 
          understand that! If you'd like some 1 on 1 lessons, or just have a question just shoot us an email "maccubingclub@gmail.com" and we will gladly help!</p>
